    /**
     * Your team at Amazon is working on a system that divides applications to a mixed cluster of computing devices.
     * Each application is identified by an integer ID, requires a fixed non-zero amount of memory to execute, and is defined to be either a foreground or background application.
     * IDs are guaranteed to be unique within their own application type, but not across types.
     * Each device should be assigned two applications at once, one foreground application and one background application.
     * Devices have limited amounts of memory and cannot execute applications that require more memory than the available memory.
     * The goal of the system is to maximize the total utilization of the memory of a given device.
     * A foreground/background application pair is considered to be optimal if there does not exist another pair that uses more memory than this pair, and also has a total less than or equal to the total memory of the device.
     * For example, if the device has 10MB memory, a foreground/background pair using a sum total of 9MB memory would be optimal if there does not exist a pair that uses a sum total of 10 MB, but would not be optimal if such a pair did exist.
     * Write an algorithm to find the sets of foreground and background application pairs that optimally utilize the given device for a given list of foreground applications and a given list of background applications.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input:
     * deviceCapacity = 7
     * foregroundAppList = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,6]]
     * backgroundAppList = [[1,2]]
     * Output:
     * [[2,1]]
     * Explanation:
     * There are only three combinations, [1,1], [2,1], and [3,1], which use a total of 4, 6, and 8 MB memory, respectively. Since 6 is the largest use that does not exceed 7, [2,1] is the only optimal pair.
     *
     * Example2:
     * Input:
     * deviceCapacity = 10
     * foregroundAppList = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7], [4, 10]]
     * backgroundAppList = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
     * Output:
     * [[2, 4], [3, 2]]
     * Explanation:
     * There are two pairs of foreground and background applications possible that optimally utilizes the given device.
     * Application 2 from foregroundAppList uses 5 memory units, and application 4 from backgroundAppList also uses 5 memory units. Combined, they add up to 10 units of memory.
     * Similarly, application 3 from foregroundAppList uses 7 memory units, and application 2 from backgroundAppList uses 3 memory units. These also add up to 10 units of memory.
     *
     * Therefore, the pairs of foreground and background applications that optimally utilize the device are [2, 4] and [3, 2].
     * Example3:
     * Input:
     * deviceCapacity = 16
     * foregroundAppList = [[2, 7], [3, 14]]
     * backgroundAppList = [[2, 10], [3, 14]]
     * Output:
     * [()]
     * Explanation:
     * There exist no combination. So, the output is a list with empty pair.
